That part of Italy which borders the Mediterranean, from the mountains
of Genoa to the extremity of Calabria, a length of about seven hundred
miles, consists, except in a few places, such as Naples, where hills
intervene, of a broad stripe of flat country extending from the
sea-shore to the lower ridges of the Apennine mountains.
